# AudioVisual-Speaker-Localization
A framework for localizing speakers on video streams by means of deep learning topologies.

This repo includes implementations for processing video streams, localizing faces, mouths and implements a fast visual voice activity detector. Please visit the following repos for implementing the ETi voice activity detctor and the visual voice activity detctor by Conv2DLSTM:

http://github.com/lvrysis/Audio-Feature-Integration  

The implementations are powered by Python.

You can experiment using the M3C Speaker Localization datasets:
